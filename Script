(Disembodied Narration)*The year is 3576 on the homeworld of the Khvlik'i, a peace loving reptilian race which helps maintain friendly relations between the space-faring empires of their sector.*
(Disembodied Narration)*Today a festival is being held in honor of a hero, <Traitor Real Name>.*
(Disembodied Narration)*<Traitor Real Name> was a shield-bearer who valiantly gave his life to stop a planet-wiping weapon in the final war of their sector, buying the time needed to secure a peace treaty.*
(Disembodied Narration)*However, as the faction representatives of the Khvlik'i finish their speech and head inside to enjoy the festivities, an unknown danger approaches.*

(Electronic Speaker)"Alert, an emergency meeting of the leaders has been called, please report to the meeting chamber as soon as possible."
(Player)"We had an emergency just last week! *What could it possibly be this time?*
(Random Other Faction Leader)"You're late <Player Name>, there's no time to dawdle. Our whole empire might be in danger."
(Player)"Is it a natural disaster? We've been stockpiling emergency rations since the war ended, shouldn't our people be safe?"
(Random Other Faction Leader)"No, our scouts have detected a heavily armed fleet traveling through our territory."
(Player)"What empire does it belong to? We finished the last of the peace talks months ago, there should be no open hostility happening within our borders."
(Random Other Faction Leader)"The flags and insignia on their ships are not known to us, we believe we are dealing with a new race who comes from another sector."
(Player)"Very well then, we should attempt first contact. Perhaps they can be reasoned with."
(Player)"Comms department! Establish a link with the leading ship of their fleet!"
(Random Lizard Worker(probs some gray suit with whatever skin color?))"On it! We are putting you through to the command room of the main ship."
(Final Boss)"*static sounds* "This is <Traitor  Rank> <Traitor Name> of the <Name> Empire, state your name and reason for contact.""
(Player)"Greetings <Traitor Rank>, this is <Player Title> <Player Name> of the Khvlik'i. Your fleet is passing through our part of this sector, we seek to learn your intentions in traveling through our territory"
(Final Boss)"We have come to widen the borders the Great <Name> Empire, our leaders demand a portion of this sector's territory. If it is not given, we shall take it by force."
(Player)"Calm yourself <Traitor rank>, there is no need for bloodshed. We cannot give up our land, but I'm sure our empires could mutually benefit through trade and cultural exchange."
(Final Boss)"Our leaders have no need of your trade vermin. The wealth in the lands we will take is already ours in the first place. Since you do not wish to give up willingly, we will take what we need by force."
(Final Boss)"Cut communications with these worthless lizards! And prepare the men for attack!*static sounds*"
(Random Other Faction Leader)"What a crude race, They must've achieved space-faring technology very recently."
(Player)"Their history is the least of our concerns right now, you must start evacuating the people. I will try to get at least my A.E.G.I.S. in working order"
(Random Other Faction Leader)"Very well, you shall lead our armies. The rest of us will hide the civillians and help provide resources for battle."

(Disembodied Narration)*Two days Later*
(Player)"My A.E.G.I.S. is up and running. We are ready to begin defending. Their fleet should arrive soon."
*maybe a bit more dialogue but then the first level starts. the first level has no boss but just ends after some time or sth and then we start putting bosses in for a total of 5 levels*
